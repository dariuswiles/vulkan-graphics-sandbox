# Vulkan Graphics Sandbox

This repo contains my experiments with the Vulkan graphics API. The majority of the code is based on the code snippets from the [excellent Vulkanalia tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/). [Vulkanalia](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/) is a lightweight Rust wrapper around the Vulkan graphics API. My original code and more details are in my [Vulkanalia Tutorial Demo repo](https://github.com/dariuswiles/vulkanalia-tutorial-demo)

The _viking_room.obj_ and _viking_room.png_ files in the _resources_ directory are based on the [Viking Room model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-room-a49f1b8e4f5c4ecf9e1fe7d81915ad38) on the [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) website. The original model was created by [nigelgoh](https://sketchfab.com/nigelgoh) and released under a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. The tutorials slightly modified this model, but I have personally made no changes.

I am releasing all other files under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE) because most of the non-comment code is from the Vulkanalia tutorial which uses this license.
